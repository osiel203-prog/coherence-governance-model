**The Coherence Governance Model (CGM)**

**The Structural Imperative: Why This Matters**

This project exists to change the core conversation around burnout, systemic abuse, and organizational failure.

We believe that organizational collapse, high turnover, and the sense of being pressured by metrics are not moral failings—they are predictable, preventable consequences of applied physics. When required effort exceeds effective capacity, the system is mathematically guaranteed to fail. This failure often results in the exact human tragedies you seek to prevent: lost homes, broken marriages, and talented people forced to quit.

The Coherence Governance Model (CGM) gives us the objective, shared metric needed to fight back. It replaces subjective negotiation with a mathematically defensible structural imperative.

**The Core Idea: Organizational Physics & The Coherence Index (CI)**

The CGM measures the Headroom—the capacity reserve available to absorb shocks and manage future work—within any team, project, or organization.

The resulting number is the Coherence Index (CI).

$\text{CI} > 0.050$: The system is in the Resilient Zone. It is robust, capable of innovation, and can handle unexpected shocks.

$\text{CI} \approx 0.00$: The system is at the Coherence Loss Threshold (CLT). Technical Collapse is imminent. $100\%$ of effective capacity is consumed just trying to meet current commitments.

$\text{CI} < 0.00$: The system is in a state of Technical Collapse. Required effort exceeds effective capacity. The system will fail.


**Call to Action: CR-90**

We need 90 data points to establish the model's validity across diverse environments.

Your mission is to model a real project you led or witnessed and submit your five key numbers.


**Calculate your CI using the live web tool.**

Submit your data in the format: Project Type (e.g., Sprints, Feature, Q3 Roadmap) | C | S | D | T | V

**Next Step: The Web Calculator**

We have built a frictionless, single-file web calculator to make testing the CI effortless.
