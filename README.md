The Coherence Governance Model (CGM)

Structural Governance: A Framework for Organizational Physics

The Coherence Governance Model (CGM) is a mathematically defensible framework designed to quantify an organization's structural health and predict systemic failure. It reframes organizational leadership as a problem of applied physics, providing a single metric—the Coherence Index ($\mathbf{CI}$)—to move decisions from subjective opinion to objective data.

Our core thesis: Organizational collapse and burnout are not moral failures; they are predictable, preventable consequences of applied physics.

📚 Core Documents

The project consists of two primary documents, serving different audiences:

Document

Format

Audience

Focus

1. Structural Governance: A Coherent Synthesis

PDF / $\mathbf{\LaTeX}$

Academics, Executives, Strategists

Rigorous Proof: Integrates Resource-Based View (RBV), Transaction Cost Economics (TCE), and Real Options Theory (ROT) to derive the core formulas for $\mathbf{E_{Total}}$ and $\mathbf{C_{Eff}}$.

2. The Coherence Action Charter

Markdown

Team Leaders, Employees, Activists

Structural Mandate: Provides the layman's translation of the five core axioms ($\mathbf{C, S, D, T, V}$) and establishes the Right to Function based on the $\mathbf{CI}$.

🎯 Call to Action: Join the CR-90 Rollout

We need 90 real-world data points to establish the model's validity across diverse environments.

We invite you to participate in CR-90 (Coherence Rollout - 90 Data Points) by modeling a project you led or witnessed and submitting your five key numbers: Capacity ($\mathbf{C}$), Scope ($\mathbf{S}$), Drift ($\mathbf{D}$), Tension ($\mathbf{T}$), and Volatility ($\mathbf{V}$).

Try the Calculator

We have built a simple, single-file web calculator to make testing the $\mathbf{CI}$ effortless.
